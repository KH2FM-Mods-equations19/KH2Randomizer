# Contributing

KH2 Randomizer wouldn't be possible without a community of contributors working on various aspects of the game. Even
this website is intended to be community-maintained. Feel free to submit an edit for any proposed changes, create a
GitHub issue containing your proposed changes, or post some proposed changes in Discord if you're not comfortable with
those other things. The website is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), with the website-specific
files located at
[https://github.com/tommadness/KH2Randomizer/tree/master/docs](https://github.com/tommadness/KH2Randomizer/tree/master/docs).
