# Updating your KH2 Randomizer installation for the Epic Games Store release v1.0.0.9_ww
Here is a summary of the steps needed to update your KH2 Randomizer installation for the latest game version on Epic:
* Update the `Mods Manager`
* Run the new `Setup Wizard`
* Install the latest version of `Panacea`
* Uninstall and then reinstall the latest version of `LuaBackend`
* (Optional but recommended) `Re-extract game files` again, overwriting your current extraction
* Update `GoA ROM` to 1.54.1

Most of these steps are built into the guided `Setup Wizard`, however there are some changes from the previous update. For a smooth update process we recommend you follow the detailed guide down below:

## Step 1: Updating the Mods Manager
1. Open the Mods Manager and click on the `Settings` tab. Then click on the `Check for Update` button in the drop down menu

2. A popup should appear that informs you an update is available. Click `Yes` to begin the update

3. The Mods Manager will close, the new update will be downloaded and applied over your current installation, and when it is complete, the Mods Manager Setup Wizard should open automatically.
   * If the `Setup Wizard` does *not* open automatically, then open up the `Mods Manager` manually and immediately run the `Setup Wizard` found under the `Settings Tab`

4. From the `Welcome Page` click `Next` to enter the `Game Edition Page`

5. There are 3 things on the `Game Edition Page` that you must do, see the below screenshot for an example:
   * Set the `Game Edition` drop down to `PC Release`
   * Set the `Launcher` option below that to `Epic Games Store`
   * Verify that the `folder location` of the PC release is correct. If your game folder location is not already filled, or you are unsure if they are correct, you can click the `Detect Installations` button to automatically locate them

6. When you are done on the `Game Edition Page`, click `Next` to go to the `Install OpenKH Panacea` page

8. On the `Install OpenKH Panacea` page, verify the `Game Collection` drop down is set to `KINGDOM HEARTS HD 1.5+2.5 ReMIX` and then click `Install Panacea for Windows`
