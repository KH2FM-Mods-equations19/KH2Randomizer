Kingdom Hearts 2 Randomizer takes items from their normal game locations and places them in random locations. Logic is
used to ensure all necessary items are obtainable.

Randomizer utilizes a mod that turns the Garden of Assemblage into a world hub, where each portal takes you to one of
the game worlds (as opposed to having a world map). This allows you to enter worlds at any time, and world progression
is maintained for each world individually.

See the various pages on this site for additional information about the randomizer.
